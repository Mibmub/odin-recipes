        <p>We love this vegetarian dish; it's simple, healthy, and super easy to make. You could easily add chicken if you're looking for a more complete meal.</p>

            <li>1 lemon, zested and juiced</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the thin spaghetti, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water.</li>
            <li>While pasta is cooking, place pine nuts in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Remove nuts to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add olive oil to the skillet and increase heat to medium. Add garlic, shallots, cherry tomatoes, and lemon zest; cook and stir until shallots have softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, lemon juice, toasted pine nuts, salt, and pepper; cook until spinach has wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add drained pasta, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and reserved pasta water; mix to combine. Serve with remaining Parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
